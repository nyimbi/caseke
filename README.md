Rough and ready court management system. This is a preliminary version (not polished or tidied up).

The only interesting bits here might be the database schema, which embeds a whole lot of domain knowledge about the Judiciary.

It includes my first attempt at auto-generating applications from database schema (much improved since then), which you can see in the ./dbs directory ina a file called gen_code
